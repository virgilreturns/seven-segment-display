# seven-segment-display

# Description:
Embedded Microcontroller NUCELO-F401RE Multi-Digit Seven Segment LED Driver using Master-Transmit Only SPI communication with 74HC595 Shift Register.

The objectives of this project are to gain experience with configuring 32-bit microcontrollers, coding in C using the STMCubeIDE, learning how to use Git, using kicad to design footprints and PCBs, 
learning how to get the PCBs manufactured, and learning how to order correct components for cheap. 

This project spanned two months to complete. The code is open-source and free to use.
